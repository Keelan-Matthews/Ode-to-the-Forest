  sentences:
  - 'My dear Ode, let me tell you of the tales of this land. Long ago, I watched
    over the world with a graceful eye, and nature flourished by my gentle hand. '
  - 'But <i>greed</i> and <i>pride</i> took root, spreading misfortune like a rotten
    vine. '
  - "The nature around us was sacrificed in <i>pride</i>\u2019s quest for power and
    <i>greed</i>\u2019s want of more. Forests were ravaged, lakes dried and the air
    filled with great smoke. "
  - Unnatural beasts began to roam the barren earth, in place of limbs they had cables,
    and in place of hearts - unnatural machinery.
  - 'This all led to <color=red>TERRADRAIN</color>, the embodiment of these vices.
    He invaded this place, and stole from me a very important seed, the <color=teal>Seed
    of Life</color>. My powers dwindle each day it is gone. '
  - 'You are my final hope, dear Ode. Only you can defeat <color=red>TERRADRAIN</color>,
    and return to me what he stole. '
