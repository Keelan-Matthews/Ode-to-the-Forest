    has always been.

    can pay tribute to them.

    I have long missed her since her sudden absence\u2026 "
  - 'Worry not of <color=#AC3232>TERRADRAIN</color> finding you in this place, my
    dear sprout. I have taken measures to ensure we are well hidden. '

    in the shadows. He may be able to assist you on your journey.
