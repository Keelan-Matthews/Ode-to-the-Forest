  sentences:
  - Ode, my dear child, let me unfold the forgotten tales of our world. In ancient
    times, greed led to devastation, leaving a barren world.
  - In their greed, they pillaged the land, ravaging forests, rivers, and air.
  - 'Your purpose, dear Ode: purify the land, restore balance, and sow renewal.'
  - Small acts of kindness will breathe life into this forsaken land.
  - Embrace your destiny, Ode, and let nature's symphony rise anew.  Find <color=red>TERRADRAIN</color>
    in the forest, and bring me the <color=green>Seed of Life</color> that he stole.
