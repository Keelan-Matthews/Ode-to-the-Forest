  sentences:
  - Ah, welcome back, young sprout. I trust you have some tasty-, er, <i>valuable</i>
    seeds you wish to part with?
  - "Could you perhaps save the idle chat until you\u2019ve brought me a seed? There\u2019s
    a good sap. "
  - "I hear <color=red>TERRADRAIN</color> stole a very important seed from <color=green>MOTHER</color>.
    I bet that would taste delic-, er, I bet it is very important to her. You should
    nab it from him\u2026 and visit me on the way back."
  - "I\u2019d much rather discuss this over some seeds, young sprout."
  - "The monocle? Why I <i>heroically</i> nabbed it from that <color=red>TERRADRAIN</color>
    fellow. It was quite the daring escapade, wouldn\u2019t you say, colleague?"
  - "(To colleague) He\u2019s a rather tasty looking sprout, don\u2019t you think?
    <color=green>MOTHER</color> really has outdone herself. "
  - "An Oracle? Oh yes\u2026 I used to sup\u2019 with her quite often. I wonder where
    she went\u2026 I do miss our conversations. "
  - "That scoundrel Trader sent you? Tell him he\u2019ll get nothing from me\u2026
    the <i>dirty cheat</i>."
  - "I\u2019d be happy to chat after you place a seed or two <i>on my desk</i>. My
    colleague and I are rather famished."
  - "Could you hand me that jar over there? There\u2019s a good fellow."
  - Good to see you, young sprout.
  - "Please don\u2019t touch the jars, dear sprout."
  - "All the jars? Why, those are my colleague\u2019s <i>prized possessions</i>!"
  - "If you\u2019d like to bestow me your seeds, <i>place them on my desk</i>."
  - Take care of yourself out there, dear sprout, the woods are a dangerous place
    for a seedling such as yourself.
  - "(To colleague) Lunch? No, no, have some patience. He may yet acquire more seeds
    for us\u2026"
