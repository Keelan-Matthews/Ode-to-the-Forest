  sentences:
  - "You have no seed\u2026"
  - I have no time for idle chit chat if not about seeds.

    there. "

    a brown seed will do just fine though. '
  - I have no time for pleasantries, young sprout, return to me once you have a seed.
  - "You\u2019ll do well to keep your hands off my desk, dear sprout, unless you
