  sentences:
  - Rise, dear one. Test the strength of your limbs and venture forth.
  - Now, direct your aim towards those distant targets, young sprout.
  - Your power, born of the radiant sun, cannot be used in the cloak of darkness.
    Neutralize the foe before you and claim its essence fragment, a valuable aid
    for your odyssey.
  - As you step into the heart of the forest, be prepared to face an onslaught of
    relentless foes. Defeat them until the purification meter at the bottom of your
    screen fills up.
  - Oh, see there! The defeated foe has gifted you a precious seed. Collect it, my
    dear, and let us reunite in the grove. There, I will share with you the tender
    secrets of its purpose.
