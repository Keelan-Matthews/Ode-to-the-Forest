  - You, my beloved Ode, have not only brought forth the <color=green>Seed of Life</color>,
    but also rid our world of the blight that was <color=red>TERRADRAIN</color>,
    the embodiment of greed and devastation.
  - With the vanquishing of that insidious force, our land breathes a sigh of relief,
    the scars of pillage slowly healing.
  - "Your heroism, your empathy, have set a new course for our world\u2014one of
    restoration, hope, and harmony."
  - As you venture into the future, may your path be graced with the essence of kindness
    and the promise of a world reborn.
